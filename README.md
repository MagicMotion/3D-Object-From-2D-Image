**3D Object From 2D Image** is an application of **Photometric Stereo** which is a technique in computer vision for estimating the surface normals of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions. It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer. By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even over-constrained.

A key assumption used here is that the surfaces of the objects are purely *Lambertian*.
